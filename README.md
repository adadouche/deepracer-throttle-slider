# DeepRacer Throttle Slider

Quick Tampermonkey script to alter the throttle button used for the DeepRacer throttle vehicule control into a slider

## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with DeepRacer, you can install the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension for your browser and the install the [DeepRacer Throttle Slider](https://gitlab.aws.dev/aws-sa-global-auto/deepracer-throttle-slider/-/raw/main/deepracer-throttle-slider.user.js).

The script is run on every page youges you will browse, so remeber to disable it once you are done having so much fun with your DeepRacer.
This is because the DeepRacer Vehicule console doesn't provide a ***URL*** that could be matched with the Tampermonkey *match* feature.
